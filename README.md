Project Report: Tic Tac Toe Game Development Using Android Studio

Introduction:
The project aimed to develop a mobile application of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for Android devices using Android Studio. The game is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols, typically X and O. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own symbols.

Objective:
The primary objective of the project was to create an interactive and user-friendly mobile game application that accurately simulates the traditional Tic Tac Toe game. The project also aimed to enhance skills in Android app development using Java and XML in Android Studio.

Determined the user interface design and functionality.
Listed the essential components and functionalities to be implemented.
Design Phase:
Designed the user interface layout using XML in Android Studio.
Created the necessary graphical assets for the game, including the game board, X and O symbols, and buttons.
Designed the game logic and algorithm for determining the winner.
Development Phase:
Implemented the user interface layout and components in XML.
Developed the game logic and functionalities in Java.
Integrated user input handling and game state management.
Tested the application for bugs and errors.
Testing Phase:
